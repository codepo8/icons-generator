# Icons Generator

Creates a set of icons from a dropped image, downloadable as a zip.

## Demo

You can check the github pages version: https://codepo8.github.io/icons-generator/

And there is a video demo on the YouTubes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hxHxo_kh2I

## Requirements and support

Uses Stuart Knightley's JSZip: http://stuk.github.io/jszip/
and Eli Grey's FileSaver: https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/

It was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari on OSX. I also showed it to a cat and it approved.

## TODO and neato ideas and such

Right now your original image needs to be square and will just be shown at 0,0.

Later versions will center images that are not and allow for moving the image and maybe cropping and fancy things. Then again, an icon should be designed square, doesn't it?
